            <p>Supermarket, large retail store operated on a self-service basis, selling groceries, fresh produce, meat, bakery and d       products, and sometimes an assortment of nonfood goods. Supermarkets gained acceptance in the United States during the 1930s.
                  The early stores were usually located in reconverted industrial buildings in outlying areas; they had no elaborate display 
    facilities, and their primary advantage was their low prices. During the 1940s and â€™50s, they became the major food-marketing channel in 
    ited States, and in the 1950s they spread through much of Europe. The extent to which they have succeeded in various countries 
    has depended on the ability or willingness of producers and wholesalers to adapt their operations to large-scale retailing. The spread o
    f supermarkets has been part of a trend in the developed countries toward reducing costs and simplifying the pattern of marketing</p>
